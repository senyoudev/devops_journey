# Devops Culture 
## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 

## Devops Values : CAMS
- **Culture**: DevOps is a culture that promotes collaboration between development and operations teams.
- **Automation**: DevOps uses automation to improve efficiency and reduce human error.
- **Measurement**: DevOps uses metrics to measure performance and identify areas for improvement.
- **Sharing**: DevOps encourages sharing knowledge and best practices across teams.

## Devops Principles : The Three Ways
- **The First Way: System thinking**: The principles of flow, from left to right, from business request to technology development to the deployment of technology to a customer.
- **The Second Way: Amplify feedback loops**: The principles of feedback, from right to left, from deployment to customer to development, so that we can prevent problems from happening again, by creating quality at the source.
- **The Third Way: Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning**: The principles of continual experimentation and learning, which requires creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from success and failure.
