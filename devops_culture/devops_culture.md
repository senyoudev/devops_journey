# Devops Culture 
## What is DevOps?
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops). It aims to shorten the systems development life cycle and provide continuous delivery with high software quality. 

## Devops Values : CAMS
- **Culture**: DevOps is a culture that promotes collaboration between development and operations teams.
- **Automation**: DevOps uses automation to improve efficiency and reduce human error.
- **Measurement**: DevOps uses metrics to measure performance and identify areas for improvement.
- **Sharing**: DevOps encourages sharing knowledge and best practices across teams.

## Devops Principles : The Three Ways
- **The First Way: System thinking**: The principles of flow, from left to right, from business request to technology development to the deployment of technology to a customer.
- **The Second Way: Amplify feedback loops**: The principles of feedback, from right to left, from deployment to customer to development, so that we can prevent problems from happening again, by creating quality at the source.
- **The Third Way: Culture of Continual Experimentation and Learning**: The principles of continual experimentation and learning, which requires creating a culture that fosters two things: continual experimentation, taking risks and learning from success and failure.

## Devops Methodologies
- **People over Process over Tools**: DevOps is about culture, and that culture must be supported by the right processes, which in turn must be supported by the right tools.
- **Continuos Delivery**: Continuous delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically built, tested, and prepared for a release to production.
- **Lean Management**: Lean management is an approach to running an organization that supports the concept of continuous improvement, a long-term approach to work that systematically seeks to achieve small, incremental changes in processes in order to improve efficiency and quality.
- **Visible Ops**: Visible Ops is a methodlogy that helps organizations to implement a set of processes and controls to manage IT infrastructure and services . It is based on the idea that the best way to manage IT infrastructure is to make it visible, and that the best way to manage IT services is to make them visible.
- **Ias Code**: Infrastructure as code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools.

## Devops Practices : 10 practices for DevOps
- **Incident command system**: Imagine a popular e-commerce website experiences a sudden outage during a major shopping event. In response, the DevOps team implements the Incident Command System:

The Incident Commander is appointed to oversee the response efforts, while technical experts focus on diagnosing the root cause of the outage.
A Communication Officer keeps stakeholders informed about the incident's status, expected resolution time, and any workarounds.
Resources are allocated based on the severity of the outage, with additional engineers called in to assist with troubleshooting and resolution.
Teams communicate via a dedicated incident management platform, providing real-time updates and collaborating on problem-solving.

- **Developers on call**: In a DevOps environment, developers are often on call to respond to incidents and troubleshoot issues. This practice helps to ensure that the people who write the code are also responsible for maintaining its stability and reliability in production.

- **Public Status Pages**: A public status page is a website that provides real-time updates on the status of an organization's services and infrastructure. This practice helps to keep customers informed about any incidents or outages that may affect their ability to use the organization's products or services.

- **Blameless Postmortems**: A blameless postmortem is a meeting held after an incident to review what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening again. The goal is to identify the root cause of the incident and implement changes to prevent similar incidents in the future, without assigning blame to any individual or team.

- **Embedded teams**: In a DevOps environment, development and operations teams are often embedded within the same organization or business unit. This practice helps to foster collaboration and communication between the two teams, leading to faster feedback loops and improved software quality.

- **The Cloud**: The cloud is a key enabler of DevOps practices, providing on-demand access to computing resources, storage, and networking. This allows organizations to rapidly provision and scale infrastructure, automate deployment and management tasks, and implement continuous delivery pipelines.

- **Andon Cord**: The Andon Cord is a practice borrowed from lean manufacturing, where workers can stop the production line if they encounter a quality issue. In a DevOps context, the Andon Cord represents a mechanism for raising awareness of problems and initiating a response to resolve them.

- **Dependency Injection**: Dependency injection is a software design pattern that allows components to be loosely coupled, making it easier to test and maintain the code. In a DevOps context, dependency injection can help to reduce the risk of software failures and improve the reliability of systems.

- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Blue-green deployments are a software release strategy that involves running two identical production environments, with one serving live traffic and the other serving as a standby. This practice allows organizations to perform zero-downtime deployments and quickly roll back changes if issues are detected.

- **The chaos monkey**: The chaos monkey is a tool developed by Netflix to test the resiliency of its cloud infrastructure. The chaos monkey randomly terminates virtual machine instances and services in the production environment, forcing engineers to design systems that can withstand unexpected failures.
