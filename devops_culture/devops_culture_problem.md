# Devops : A culture problem

## The IT crowd and the business crowd

The IT crowd and the business crowd have different goals and priorities. The IT crowd is focused on stability, reliability, and security, while the business crowd is focused on speed, agility, and innovation. This can lead to tension and conflict between the two groups, as they struggle to find a balance between these competing priorities.

## Use your words

- **Blameless Postmortems**: A blameless postmortem is a meeting held after an incident to review what happened, why it happened, and how to prevent it from happening again. The goal is to identify the root cause of the incident and implement changes to prevent similar incidents in the future, without assigning blame to any individual or team.

- **Transparent uptime and downtime** : A public status page is a website that provides real-time updates on the status of an organization's services and infrastructure. This practice helps to keep customers informed about any incidents or outages that may affect their ability to use the organization's products or services.

## Do unto others

- **How to build a culture of collaboration and trust between the IT crowd and the business crowd?** : The key to building a culture of collaboration and trust between the IT crowd and the business crowd is to focus on shared goals and outcomes, rather than individual priorities and agendas. This requires open and honest communication, a willingness to listen and learn from each other, and a commitment to working together to achieve common objectives.

=> Be Open and Transparent
=> Be Empathetic and Understanding
=> Be Collaborative and Inclusive

## Throwing things over the wall

we will not achieve results if we only name a team "DevOps" and expect them to solve all the problems. DevOps is not a team, it's a culture. It's a way of working that requires collaboration and communication between all parts of the organization.

we can use minimum viable product (MVP) to get feedback from the business crowd and iterate on the product to improve it.



# KaiZen : Continuous Improvement

KaiZen is a Japanese word that means "change for the better" or "continuous improvement". It is a philosophy that focuses on making small, incremental changes to improve processes, products, and services. In a DevOps context, KaiZen can help organizations to identify areas for improvement, experiment with new ideas, and learn from success and failure.
