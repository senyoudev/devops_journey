## How to manage Containers ?

# 1 - Orchestrating Containers

Orchestration is the process of automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. 

# 2- Docker Swarm

Docker Swarm is a container orchestration platform that allows you to manage a cluster of Docker hosts as a single virtual system. It provides features such as service discovery, load balancing, and health checks, as well as tools for managing and monitoring containerized applications. Docker Swarm is designed to be easy to use and integrates seamlessly with the Docker ecosystem.

- **Task** : Container instance
- **Service** : A set of tasks 

# 3- Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that provides a way to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides features such as service discovery, load balancing, and health checks, as well as tools for managing and monitoring containerized applications. Kubernetes is designed to be highly scalable and resilient, making it ideal for modern, cloud-native applications.

# 4-Mesos

Apache Mesos is a distributed systems kernel that provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications or frameworks. It provides features such as service discovery, load balancing, and health checks, as well as tools for managing and monitoring containerized applications. Mesos is designed to be highly scalable and resilient, making it ideal for modern, cloud-native applications.

# 5-Cloud Container Services

Cloud container services, such as Amazon ECS, Google Kubernetes Engine, and Azure Container Service, provide managed container orchestration platforms that allow you to deploy, manage, and scale containerized applications in the cloud. These services provide features such as service discovery, load balancing, and health checks, as well as tools for managing and monitoring containerized applications. They are designed to be easy to use and integrate seamlessly with cloud infrastructure.
