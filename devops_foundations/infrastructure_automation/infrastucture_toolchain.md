## Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Toolchain

### Version Control System (VCS)
- **Tool:** Git
- **Description:** Git is a distributed version control system used to manage and track changes to infrastructure code, enabling collaboration, versioning, and rollback.

### Infrastructure Provisioning
- **Tool:** Terraform
- **Description:** Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a declarative configuration language to define infrastructure resources across multiple cloud providers.

### Configuration Management
- **Tool:** Ansible
- **Description:** Ansible is an open-source automation engine that automates cloud provisioning, configuration management, application deployment, and other IT tasks.

### Container Orchestration
- **Tool:** Kubernetes
- **Description:** Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

### Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)
- **Tool:** Jenkins
- **Description:** Jenkins is an open-source automation server used for building, testing, and deploying software projects continuously, facilitating CI/CD pipelines.

### Monitoring and Logging
- **Tool:** Prometheus
- **Description:** Prometheus is an open-source monitoring and alerting toolkit designed for reliability and scalability, providing metrics collection, storage, and visualization capabilities.

### Configuration Repository
- **Tool:** HashiCorp Vault
- **Description:** Vault is a tool for securely managing secrets and sensitive data across distributed infrastructure, providing centralized access control, encryption, and auditing.


### Artifact Repository
- **Tool:** Docker Hub
- **Description:** Docker Hub is a cloud-based registry service for storing and sharing Docker container images, facilitating the distribution and deployment of containerized applications.

### Collaboration and Communication
- **Tool:** Slack
- **Description:** Slack is a messaging platform that enables real-time communication and collaboration among team members, providing channels for discussions, file sharing, and integration with other tools.

This toolchain represents a typical set of tools used in an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) environment, covering version control, infrastructure provisioning, configuration management, container orchestration, CI/CD, monitoring, security, cloud provider integration, artifact management, and collaboration.
