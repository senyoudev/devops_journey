Immutable deployment is a key concept in DevOps that involves treating infrastructure and application deployments as immutable, meaning that once deployed, they remain unchanged throughout their lifecycle. Immutable deployments contrast with mutable deployments, where changes are made directly to running instances or environments.

Let's say you have a web application that you want to deploy using immutable deployment practices:

- **Versioned Application Artifact**: You build your web application into a versioned artifact, such as a Docker image, containing all the necessary dependencies and configurations.

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: You define your infrastructure requirements as code using tools like Terraform or AWS CloudFormation. This includes specifying the virtual machines, load balancers, security groups, and other resources needed to run your application.

- **Deployment Pipeline**: You set up a deployment pipeline using a CI/CD tool like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or CircleCI. This pipeline is triggered whenever there's a new version of your application code.

- **Immutable Deployment Process**:

When a new version of your application code is pushed to the version control repository, the CI/CD pipeline triggers a build process.
The build process creates a new Docker image containing the updated application code.
The CI/CD pipeline then deploys this new Docker image to a fresh set of virtual machines or containers, which are provisioned using the IaC templates.
Once the new instances are successfully deployed and pass automated tests, they are added to the load balancer, and traffic is gradually shifted to them.
If any issues are detected during deployment or testing, the deployment process can be rolled back by simply redirecting traffic back to the previous version of the application.
Zero Downtime Deployment: With immutable deployments, there's no need to update or modify existing instances. Instead, new instances are created and deployed alongside the existing ones, allowing for zero-downtime deployments.

- **Immutable Infrastructure** : Once deployed, the instances and infrastructure remain unchanged throughout their lifecycle. Any updates or changes require the creation of a new, immutable deployment, ensuring consistency and predictability.
